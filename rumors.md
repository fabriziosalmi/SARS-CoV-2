Wuhan South China Seafood Market has been closed, unexplained pneumonia has a mature surveillance system
...
Hong Wei (pseudonym) is the owner of an aquatic shop on Sixth Street in the Western District. He told the Beijing News that he only heard on the morning of December 31 that there were three shop owners who were often playing cards at a stall near Tenth Street two days ago. After that, he sent a WeChat greeting to one of the bosses, and the other party replied "infected with a virus".

Bai Xiaomei (pseudonym), a merchant from the Western District, said that a couple she knew who was doing business in the seafood market was also hospitalized, "for two or three days." According to her, both were pneumonia caused by a cold.

Under the guidance of the owner, a reporter from the Beijing News found the storefronts of four shop owners who were hospitalized for pneumonia for unknown reasons. These stores operate vegetables, edible fungi, seasonings, fish and shrimp, etc., and are currently closed. Among the four stores, the vegetable store and the edible fungus store are adjacent, and the other two belong to different neighborhoods.

Xu Ping (a pseudonym), a neighbor of one of the seasoning shops, told the Beijing News reporter that the owner of the shop was a 40--50-year-old man who usually stayed up late to play cards. He had "don't care" after catching a cold recently. At first He didn't go to the doctor. He went to the hospital only a few days after he noticed that his condition became worse. He was eventually diagnosed with pneumonia.

"I was surprised when I first heard that he was hospitalized. Was he still hospitalized for a bit of a cold?" Xu Ping said, and he was not worried about being infected. "If SARS is not yet infected, it won't be one day or two!" When a reporter from the Beijing News met Xu Ping, she was preparing to close the house and was wearing no mask.
...
On December 31, a reporter from the Beijing News visited the Houhu Courtyard of Wuhan Central Hospital, which is about 2 kilometers away from the South China Seafood Market. The official website of the hospital shows that Houhu Courtyard is a high-quality medical resource of Wuhan Central Hospital in the northern part of Hankou. The extension has filled the gap that there are no large tertiary hospitals in the local area.

A 60-year-old patient in the emergency ward, Li Jing (pseudonym), told the Beijing News reporter that she had been treated in the Houhu District of Wuhan Central Hospital on December 27 for gallbladder disease. Since then, she has seen 4 people from the South China Seafood Market. Merchants came to the emergency room due to pneumonia.

According to Li Jing, when the first pneumonia patient from the South China Seafood Market was admitted to the hospital, the hospital did not consider it abnormal and let the patient live with the other patients in the emergency ward. Soon, a middle-aged man accompanied his mother to the hospital. The man ran a poultry shop in the South China Seafood Market. His mother developed some symptoms of pneumonia and had a high fever. The man soon began to have a fever and was hospitalized with his mother.

"When his family came to accompany the bed, he mentioned to the doctor that several people in the South China Seafood Market have recently been hospitalized because of similar symptoms. Some are in Tongji Hospital and some are in Xiehe Hospital." Li Jing said that there were already three people in Houhu Hospital at this time. Patients with pneumonia related to the South China Seafood Market were hospitalized. Doctors began to be vigilant and asked to record the occupational status of the three patients. They learned that the man's mother often went to South China Seafood Market to deliver meals.

On December 29, Li Jing saw that the fourth pneumonia patient from the South China Seafood Market was admitted to the emergency room. The hospital immediately transferred the four patients' beds to the southwest corner of the ward, and they were treated in isolation that afternoon.

In mid-December, local media in Wuhan reported that Wuhan had entered a period of high flu, and the number of children in many pediatric hospitals surged. A reporter from the Beijing News told a number of medical staff in Houhu District that they had received patients with respiratory diseases this year, but they did not respond.

On the evening of December 31, the son of the owner of a seasoning shop in the western area of ​​the South China Seafood Market told the Beijing News reporter that his father had been treated in Houhu District after being diagnosed with pneumonia. He was originally going to be discharged but was transferred to another hospital for treatment. He didn't know the specific reason.
...
On the afternoon of December 31, a staff member of the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told the Beijing News reporter that all the researchers participated in the investigation of unexplained pneumonia, but he said that the institute would not release information separately, and related researchers were inconvenient. Interviews are subject to the information of the Health and Health Commission.

Public information shows that China has incorporated unexplained pneumonia into the disease control surveillance system more than ten years ago. The purpose of surveillance is to detect some infectious cases in a timely manner, issue early warning and take preventive measures as soon as possible.

In 2004, in order to screen for possible SARS (SARS) cases, human avian influenza cases, and other infectious respiratory diseases, the original Ministry of Health required nationwide surveillance of unexplained pneumonia cases, and issued the National Implementation Plan for Surveillance of Unexplained Pneumonia Cases. (Trial), and adjusted the plan in 2007 based on previous monitoring experience, and released the National Surveillance, Investigation and Management Plan for Unknown Causes of Pneumonia.

The plan stipulates that cases of unexplained pneumonia refer to the following 4 cases of pneumonia that cannot be diagnosed at the same time: (1) fever (underarm temperature ≥ 38 ℃); (2) imaging characteristics of pneumonia; (3) In the early stage of onset, the total number of white blood cells is reduced or normal, or the lymphocyte classification count is reduced; (4) After standardized antibacterial treatment, there is no significant improvement or progressive worsening of the condition.

The Beijing News reporter retrieved relevant papers and found that since 2004, the relevant departments of disease control and other regions across the country have released monitoring results for pneumonia of unknown origin.

"2004-2009 Cases of Unexplained Pneumonia in China" written by researchers such as Ni Ni and others from the Office of Disease Control and Emergency Management of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention collects cases of unexplained pneumonia from 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Studies show that 2004 From April 2014 to December 31, 2009, a total of 864 cases of unexplained pneumonia reported through the disease surveillance information report management system, telephone and fax, including 35 confirmed cases of human avian influenza, and exclusion of unexplained pneumonia diagnosed as other diseases Of the 793 cases, 36 cases of unexplained pneumonia have not been ruled out so far. Studies have shown that most cases of human bird flu are detected by unexplained pneumonia surveillance.
...
In recent years, unexplained pneumonia cases have occurred throughout the country, and the causes are different.

The Beijing News reporter searched for public reports and found that in 2013, 4 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were found in Shenzhen, and the final diagnosis was influenza A H1N1 influenza. In the same year, 4 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause appeared in Beijing and were eventually diagnosed as ordinary pneumonia or influenza. In 2013, cases of unexplained severe pneumonia occurred in Shanghai, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, of which 3 were confirmed to be infected with H7N9 avian influenza and 2 died.

Evaluation of the Unexplained Pneumonia Surveillance System by Wang Yu, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, shows that since the establishment of an unknown cause pneumonia surveillance system in 2004, as of December 31, 2016, 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) 1666 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported through the disease monitoring information reporting management system, of which 8% were human cases of avian influenza, and 76% of the reported cases were diagnosed with other diseases, such as viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, unknown pathogen pneumonia, etc. In addition, 15% of cases were diagnosed with upper respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 14% of other unexplained diseases and 2% lack information on disease outcomes.

A paper published by two physicians from the Department of Infectious Diseases and Endemic Disease Control of the Fangshan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing published in the "Occupation and Health" in April 2019 shows that in May 2018, an unknown cause of clustering occurred in a primary school in Fangshan District, Beijing. Pneumonia epidemic, more than 20 students in a grade had fever, cough, sore throat, pneumonia and other symptoms. A large number of pneumonia cases were diagnosed on chest radiographs, which attracted great attention from hospital doctors. After consultation and treatment by relevant departments, they were finally diagnosed as a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection cause.

According to the report of the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee, Wuhan organized consultations with clinical medical, epidemiological, and virological experts from Tongji Hospital, Provincial CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Infectious Disease Hospital and Wuhan CDC Experts analyzed the above cases from viral pneumonia from the aspects of illness, treatment outcome, epidemiological investigation, and preliminary laboratory tests.

The notice mentioned that viral pneumonia is more common in winter and spring, and can be spread or outbreak. The clinical manifestations are fever, soreness, a small part of breathing difficulties, and pulmonary infiltration. Viruses that cause viral pneumonia are common with influenza viruses. The disease can be prevented and controlled, and indoor air circulation can be prevented to prevent the public places and crowded places where there is no air circulation. People can wear masks when going out. Symptomatic treatment is the main clinical practice, and bed rest is required. If you have the above symptoms, especially the persistent fever, you should go to the medical institution in time.

According to CCTV news, the expert group of the National Health Commission has arrived in Wuhan on the morning of December 31, and is conducting relevant inspection and verification work. According to "People's Daily" reports, a number of people in Wuhan hospitals said that the current cause is not clear, and it cannot be concluded that it is the SARS virus rumored on the Internet. Other severe pneumonia is more likely. And even for the SARS virus, there has been a mature prevention and treatment system before, and citizens do not need to panic.
